  //We would like you to explore a few advanced/less common Selenium techniques.
  //1. How do we handle file upload and download in Selenium?
//
//  val fileInput: Nothing = driver.findElement(By.cssSelector("input[type=file]"))
//  fileInput.sendKeys(uploadFile.getAbsolutePath)
//  driver.findElement(By.id("file-submit")).click


  //2. How do we handle scrolling the page in Sel
  //js.ex
  //4. What is a shadow DOM?
  /*
  Shadow DOM (Document Object Model) is a web standΩard that provides encapsulation and scoping for HTML and CSS within a webpage. It allows developers to create isolated DOM trees within the main document’s DOM, ensuring that the styles and behavior of the encapsulated components don’t affect the rest of the page and vice versa. This is especially useful in creating reusable and modular web components.
